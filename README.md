<h2>Explorer in Mars</h2>

<h4>
  A robotic traveler is positioned on the surface of the Mars planet by NASA. 
  This rectangular surface is displayed with the help of the camera on the robotic navigator and sends these images to the world.
  The position of the robotic navigator are indicated by the x-y coordinates and the direction letters in the compass (N, W, S, E). 
  A 0.0, N position for the robotic traveler indicates that the direction of the rectangular surface is at the lower left corner and the direction is north.
  NASA sends a string of letters to control the robotic explorer.These letters are ’L‘, ’R‘ and ler M which rotate 90 degrees to the left or right without moving the robotic navigator and camera.
  Letter M let is a step forward in the direction of the robotics navigator.
  t is assumed that the robotic traveler goes 1 step in the direction of north (N) when it is located in the coordinate (x, y + 1) from (x, y).
